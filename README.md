## What is this?

This is a plugin for Recaf which can automatically detects a Minecraft Forge Mods version using the mcmod.info and
applies the correct mapping. It also allows you to export the Forge MDK for the version.

The mappings and mdks are stored in this jar file, so you don't have to manually find them.
